== ABOUT ==

After years of internal development, we are pleased to bring our JavaScript map control to the open-source world in the form of a jQuery plugin.

== DOCS ==

Documentation is hosted at http://host.appgeo.com/libs/geo/test/

== TO DO ==

* Change getPixelSize docs to mention that it's a read-only method property (is there a better way in jQuery UI)
* Change getPixelSize to pixelSize but leave it as a method
* [BUG] geomap does not initialize if jQuery UI is already included
* Auto-handle window resize events
* [BUG] Mouse wheel on bad or missing tile doesn't zoom out on first rotate

== CHANGELOG ==

=== Version alpha2 ===
* Support dynamic map services

=== Version alpha1 ===
* Create interactive map widget
* Support tiled map services
